				<h3>The first reports of the presence of dinosaurs in Yakutia were made by geologist Hertz in 1904. In 1960, geologist Vadim Filatov discovered the location of early Cretaceous dinosaurs (145-125 million years ago) on the Teete stream, the Vilyui tributary, in the Suntar district. Only in 1988, scientists from the Palaeontological Institute (Moscow) and the Institute of Geology (Yakutsk) discovered fossilised teeth of ancient animals. Three dinosaur families were found in the Suntar district. Since 2002, scientists from the Institute of Geology of Diamonds and Precious Metals and the Palaeontological Institute (Moscow) have begun to study Teete. The only dinosaur specialist in Yakutia today is the chief researcher of the Laboratory of Stratigraphy and Palaeontology of the Institute of Geology of Diamonds and Precious Metals of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Honorary Member of the Palaeontological Council of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Doctor of Geological and Mineralogical Sciences Petr Nikolaevich Kolosov.
